# NOTES:
#
#   1) The goal of a baseball game is to score more runs (points) than the other team.
#
#   2) Each team has 9 batters who have an opportunity to hit a ball with a bat in a 
#      predetermined order. 

#   3) Each time a batter has an opportunity to bat, we call it a  
#      plate appearance (PA).
#
#   4) Five ways a batter can succeed (not make an out) ->
#
#      4-a) Single: the batter hits the ball and gets to first base.
#      4-b) Double (2B): the batter hits the ball and gets to second base.
#      4-c) Triple (3B): the batter hits the ball and gets to third base.
#      4-d) Home Run (HR): the batter hits the ball and goes all the way home and scores a run.
#      4-e) Bases on balls (BB): the pitcher fails to throw the ball through a predefined area 
#           considered to be hitTable (the strike zone), so the batter is permitted to go to 
#           first base. 
#  
#   5) The task is to build the best team with a limited budget of $40 million dollars.
